# Backbone Koans

A set of jasmine powered koans for learning [Backbone.js](http://http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone).

The koans verify behavior of a sample Tooter app, which allows people to make little 141 character Toots.

(Because we all know that extra 141st character makes all the difference!)

## How to Run

Open your favorite browser, and load the specrunner.html file. You should see many failing specs.

Work your way through the jasmine specs in the koans/ directory, and when you finish you should have
a better understanding of how to create and test a Backbone app.
